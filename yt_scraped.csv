CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,Casey on a Thursday like it’s 2015 👏🏽👏🏽 hell yeah
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,Casey drawing life advice on construction paper gives me such 2016 daily vlog nostalgia
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,literally got the CHILLS when the &quot;great things&quot; mirror reflected the hard path. No one will ever beat Caseys creativity for storytelling. Take a bow brother
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,Seeing Candace’s reaction just made me fully start crying. YAYYY!!!!!!!!!
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,Got to admit.. it made me shed a tear at the end with Candice’s reaction.
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,"Roberto is the true hero here, ran over by the shopping cart granny and still finishes at a great time 😂"
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,"I’ve been following you since 2015, back when I was in high school, watching your videos to improve my English from the other side of the world. Now I&#39;m a grad student in New York, and I had the chance to cheer you on at the marathon! You probably have no idea how much those five seconds when you passed by meant to me. I guess I just wanted to say thank you for all the years of inspiration and huge congrats for achieving your dream!"
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,Having your spouse be that proud of you makes you feel like you can move mountains. Excellent story Casey!
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,You actually inspired me to run my own marathon over 5 years ago. I haven’t run another since because my hard thing was going from not running at all to running 26.2 miles before I turned 30. It took me a year and a half to even attempt a race but I managed to finish one 2 months before my 30th birthday. Goal achieved. Sometimes someone’s hard thing also makes others want to pursue their own so don’t discount that reaction per Newton’s 3rd law. Keep inspiring man. And congrats on your sub 3. Finally.
CaseyNeistat,DO HARD THINGS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0,"The story is so perfect; Roberto crashing out. Textbook setup, conflict, resoloution. Loved it"

PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,We deserve to hear from Alex Jones. It’s way overdue and now it’s the peefect time.
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"I worked in Afghanistan from 2011-2019...everything he is saying here is not only true, it is an extremely sanitized version...people truly have no idea of the darkness"
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"A friend of mine from almost 20 years ago came back from Afghanistan (he was a marine and served in Iraq and Afghanistan) and told me about all of the pedophilia that was going on over there and he said that everyone was told not to intervene on what they saw, no matter how awful it was. Some marines and soldiers broke that rule and were disciplined for protecting young kids from being SA&#39;d. It is absolutely mind-blowing what is being done to those who these politicians say protect our freedoms. It is sinister and deranged. My friend is no longer with us and he did not die in combat... I will leave it at that."
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,I love how the top comment on every vid for the past few weeks has just been people begging for Alex Jones
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"I am a vet and I currently work as a trauma therapist for combat veterans. I hear heartbreaking stories like this all day long. It’s a huge issue in our country. <br><br>PSA if you live in San Antonio TX area and you are a combat veteran or active duty struggling with PTSD, go to Mission Resiliency Program at Laural Ridge Treatment Center. We work with Vets and active duty soldiers to help heal the wounds of PTSD."
