@83silverdub,"4 years ago i got rid of a 800$/month car and bought a 5,000 shit box that i still have, best thing ever. 99% of cars only go down in value",Mark Tilbury,THE BIGGEST WEALTH KILLER EVER
@bigburrito308,The problem is we have no capital to invest......say 22hr is ur pay. 22 x 40hrs weekx 4 weeks= 3520 or like 3100 after tax. 1500 average now comes out for rent....450 utilities a month leaves about 1000 a month for food and pleasure.  And that if you aren&#39;t accounting for  any medical expenses<br>Or student loans you have to pay off. <br><br>Basically you only have a chance if you don&#39;t have car payments and you don&#39;t have student loans like me and I could barely save enough to have an emergency fund.,Mark Tilbury,THE BIGGEST WEALTH KILLER EVER
