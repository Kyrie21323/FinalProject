We work with Vets and active duty soldiers to help heal the wounds of PTSD."
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"When he started talking about his first combat experience, it brought back memories of my own. It was challenging to listen to.  <br><br>I, too, have ZERO trust in politicians."
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"A friend of mine from almost 20 years ago came back from Afghanistan (he was a marine and served in Iraq and Afghanistan) and told me about all of the pedophilia that was going on over there and he said that everyone was told not to intervene on what they saw, no matter how awful it was. Some marines and soldiers broke that rule and were disciplined for protecting young kids from being SA&#39;d. It is absolutely mind-blowing what is being done to those who these politicians say protect our freedoms. It is sinister and deranged. My friend is no longer with us and he did not die in combat... I will leave it at that."
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,Bring on Alex Jones! It’s time.
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"This is why  I like this podcast.  Things get talked about that are very important and it goes out to a huge audience - without being curated, vetted, censored.   People need to know the truth and context associated with it."
PowerfulJRE,Joe Rogan Experience #2230 - Evan Hafer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCepzIrkbDE,"Ok, wow, he actually used the term &quot;Bacha Baazi,&quot; which is exactly what it&#39;s referred to as. One of the literal translations of this phrase means &quot;Doing kinds,&quot; &quot;Bacha&quot; means kid, and &quot;Baazi&quot; means doing. It&#39;s not only common in Afghanistan but also in parts of Pakistan, where we&#39;re located, and other regions of South East Asia. Its an epidemic we are actively trying to mitigate and tackle here at Tomorrow&#39;s Journal. We&#39;re glad to see it brought to light on a platform as great as the JRE. Thank you, Joe Rogan."
