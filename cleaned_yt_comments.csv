"“So your money works for you, not the other way around” is honestly one of the best things I’ve heard you say. Bravo 👍"
"4 years ago i got rid of a 800$/month car and bought a 5,000 shit box that i still have, best thing ever. 99% of cars only go down in value"
The problem is we have no capital to invest......say 22hr is ur pay. 22 x 40hrs weekx 4 weeks= 3520 or like 3100 after tax. 1500 average now comes out for rent....450 utilities a month leaves about 1000 a month for food and pleasure.  And that if you aren&#39;t accounting for  any medical expenses<br>Or student loans you have to pay off. <br><br>Basically you only have a chance if you don&#39;t have car payments and you don&#39;t have student loans like me and I could barely save enough to have an emergency fund.
Tax is only a punishment for the poor
I probably would live the same life and work the same job. My car payment is 147 bucks a month.
"I don&#39;t have a car payment,  and I&#39;m still not comfortable with a ex wife 😢😢😢😢😢😢"
Mark is actually the first British person that are understand when he speaks  😂😂
"I dont have a car payment, why would I not work the same job? Living requires a lot more money than a car payment. Food, utilities, rent (unless you have a payed off house too), health just to name a few."
Stocks and new skills is good advice but real estate is only if your already rich
